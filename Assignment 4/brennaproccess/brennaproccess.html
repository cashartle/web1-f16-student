<h3>Client Essay</h3>
<p>Brenna Kennedy is a junior in industrial design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. In addition to being an industrial designer, she also has a T-shirt business called "Shirts by Brenna." Brenna would like a website that mostly focuses on her industrial design work, but also shows her T-shirt business. Brenna would like the focus to be on industrial design. She would like links to both her process work and fished pieces for ID. She would also like a link that briefly describes her T-shirt business and has links to both her etsy page and facebook page. The people who will be visiting her site are mostly potential clients or employers for her industrial design work, and anyone who is interested in purchasing her T-shirts. She would like the website to be sleek and classy "but in a cool way like James Bond." When I asked her if she had any additional requirements for the website she said she did not. </p>
	<p>Since her industrial design work and her T-shirt designs are so different, it will be interesting to try to showcase both on the same website. Her T-shirts have much more of a personal touch. They are hand sewn shirts with funky patterns, while her industrial design work is more clean and polished. I think a simple layout is best so that it does not add extra variety to her already various portfolio of work. It will be a challenge to perfectly balance the importance of her industrial design work, while still giving her T-shirt business some attention. Perhaps I could make a separate layout for her T-shirt line to really distinguish it from the rest of her work.</p>
<p>From our discussion, I am thinking of a simple aesthetic (mostly black and white) with simple links and sans serif type. Since our first meeting, I have shown her a basic sketch of her site. The opening page will feature an image of her working on her project. It will display links to her industrial design work, her T-shirt brand, and an about page where you viewer can learn more about Brenna. At the bottom the the page will be contact information for Brenna. When you click on the industrial design tab there will two sections available: process and finished work. For T shirts by Brenna there will be links to her social media and her etsy page as well as images of her shirt designs. When I showed this sketch to Brenna, she approved and said she was excited to see the next phase. </p>

		<p>Behance is a good place to start when looking at how to organize a portfolio online. Although it is a different kind of website than I will be designing, it is a good jumping off point.</p>

			<p>ANDESIGN is another design site with a simple, clean layout. It has a bit more color than I think I will use, but it still a good reference for setting up the layout of her page.</p>
