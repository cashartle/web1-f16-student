<h4>Client Essay</h4>
<p>Brenna Kennedy is a junior in industrial design at Massachusetts College of Art and Design. In addition to being an industrial designer, she also has a T-shirt business called "Shirts by Brenna." Brenna would like a website that mostly focuses on her industrial design work, but also shows her T-shirt business. Brenna would like the focus to be on industrial design. She would like links to both her process work and fished pieces for ID. She would also like a link that briefly describes her T-shirt business and has links to both ther etsy page and facebook page. The people who wil be visiting her site are mostly potential clients or employers for her industrial design work, and anyone who is interested in purchasing her T-shirts. She would like the website to be sleek and classy "but in a cool way like James Bond." From our discussion, I am thinking of a simple aesthetic (mostly black and white) with simple links.</p>
