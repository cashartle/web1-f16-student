She is from Enfield, Connecticut, where she grew up with her three siblings (and six cats). Her work ranges in media, creating pieces in ceramics,claymation, fabric, 3D printing, or woodworking. Her ultimate goal in the design realm would be to integrate products into everyday environments in a way that makes people more aware of the space they are in.</p>
