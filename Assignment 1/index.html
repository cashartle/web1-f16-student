	<h3>List of websites</h3>
	
	
	<ul>1. Netflix</ul>
	<a1>Netflix is a website I spend a good amount of time on. I enjoy watching documentaries in particular.</a1>
	

	<ul>2. This American Life https://www.thisamericanlife.org </ul>

		<l12>I am a huge fan of This American Life. I love to listen to their podcasts while I'm doing homework, cooking, or riding on the bus or train. I just go to their archive page and listen to different broadcasts from 1995 to 2016.

			
<ul>3. Pandora</ul>
			
<l1>I love to listen to Pandora while I'm doing homework (If I get tired of This American Life).</l1>
		
<ul>4. Facebook</ul>
				
<kr2>Facebook is a website I frequently visit but feel a bit strange about. It always creeped me out a bit. </kr2>

<ul>5. Moodle </ul>
								
<ow2>Moodle is another site I visit frequently. This is where I post many assignments for my liberal arts classes.</ow2>

<h5>Why I am taking this class and what I hope to achieve through it?</h5>
										
<p>I don't know very much about web design, but I think it's an extremely useful (and marketable) skill to have as a Graphic Designer. I hope to become skilled in web design and learn to use html and css</p>
