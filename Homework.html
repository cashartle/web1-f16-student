	<h2>List of websites</h2>
	
	
	<ul>1. Netflix</ul>
	<li>

	<ul>2. This American Life </ul>
	<li>

	<p> 
		
		<l12>I am a huge fan of This American Life. I love to listen to their podcasts while I'm doing homework, cooking, or riding on the bus or train. I just go to their archive page and listen to different broadcasts from 1995 to 2016.

			<ul>3. Pandora</ul>
			<li>
			<a href="https://www.pandora.com">pandora.com</a>

					<ul>4. Facebook</ul>

										<p>II don't know very much about web design, but I think it's an extremely useful (and marketable) skill to have as a Graphic Designer. I hope to become skilled in web design and learn to use html and css</p>
