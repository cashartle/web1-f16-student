<h2>Why do you want a portfolio page?</h2>
<p>I want a website to display my illustrations and graphic design work all in one place. It would be extra handy on job applications to be able to add a link to a personal website. I want to portray myself primarily as a graphic designer, but also as an illustrator. It would be especially nice to create my own portfolio website so that I can display my work exactly how I please. It can be difficult with websites like Behance because they are not as customizable.</p>
